# MagneticFieldSimulation
Wolfram Mathematica based application simulates the distribution induced by currents. You can place some wires in a 3D space (set x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2), set the electric currents inside​​ them and see what is the distribution of vertical projection  of the magnetic field​ induced by theese currents at hight z above the z=0 plane. Black lines on the plot are the positions of the wires. Exported CSV files are saved in demonstration directory and can be imported later.
